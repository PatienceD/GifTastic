Overview:

I've used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates 10 gifs of the animals listed within my buttons. The user can add as many animals as they want and recieve 10 gifs for the animal of their choosing. Each time the user requests additional gifs based on the button they press, the page will add 10 more gifs without overwriting the original 10 gifs. 

This webpage is mobile responsive so feel free to use it across multiple devices!
